# Final Project - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the final project developed by Seif El-Din Sweilam for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at CCSED 26 - Mansoura University.

The project consists of two applications:

1. Web Server by Queue
2. Task Management by Stack

## Web Server by Queue

The Web Server application is designed to handle incoming requests using a queue data structure. It ensures that requests are processed in the order they are received. The application utilizes the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle to manage the request queue.

## Task Management by Stack

The Task Management application is built using a stack data structure. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, removing, and organizing them in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.

## Conclusion

The final project demonstrates the implementation of queue and stack data structures in two different applications. It showcases the understanding of data structures and algorithms concepts learned throughout the course.
